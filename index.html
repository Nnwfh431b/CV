  <p>Greetings National Bowling Association,<br />
    My name is Mr Bowling ball and I have been practing my bowling skills for a long long time. I have been working <em>very</em> hard, and I hope that you will accept <br />
    me to be listed in your NBA trials. I enjoy long walks down the bowling alley and being stored on bowling alley shelves. <br />
    here are some of my achievements that I believe should make <strong>me</strong> a potential applicant to become a pro bowling ball.</p>
